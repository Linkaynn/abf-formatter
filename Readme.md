# Anima Beyond Foundry Formatter

Transforms from the original excel token file to the Anima Beyond Foundry actor system

# FAQ

#### Works with all excel versions?

The formatter reads Excel cells, so, if your version contains the data on same position as the last one tested (v8.6.1)

#### It will break my character?

Of course, I hope not. Currently, I have been using it on almost 50 characters and the results are good. **I recommend doing a character backup before use it: [instructions here](https://www.jeseromero.com/abf-formatter/assets/export-actor-example.mp4)**

#### I have an idea, where I can send my feedback?
